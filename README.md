## Refactoring HTML and CSS code:

*For our homework we were given the task of refactoring the provided code. The aim was to optimize the website of a marketing agency and make changes that would follow accessibility standards.

*I refactored the HTML code shown below by swapping <div class="header"> with the semantic html element: <header>
I also included the semantic HTML element <nav>. This is used to define a set of navigation links inside the header.
By including semantic HTML elements, we provide additional infomation about the document, which aids in communication to both the browser and the developer.

<body>
   <header>
       <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
   <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    </header>
